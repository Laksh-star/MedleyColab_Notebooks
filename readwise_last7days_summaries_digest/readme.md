# Readwise Weekly Digest Generator (Google Colab)

This Google Colab notebook automates the process of fetching your recent Readwise highlights and documents, and then leverages Anthropic's Claude to generate a concise, personalized weekly research digest. It's designed to help you quickly review your learning and insights from the past week.

## Features

*   **Automated Data Retrieval**: Fetches all documents and highlights from your Readwise account updated or created in the last 7 days (customizable).
*   **AI-Powered Summarization**: Uses the Anthropic Claude model to read through your Readwise data and produce a structured weekly digest, identifying key themes and takeaways.
*   **Multiple Output Formats**: Saves the raw Readwise data as both a CSV and a Markdown table. The AI-generated digest is saved as a Markdown file.
*   **Colab-Ready**: Designed to run seamlessly in Google Colab, with secure handling of API keys via Colab Secrets.

## Setup

1.  **Open in Google Colab**: Click the "Open in Colab" badge or upload the `.ipynb` file to Google Colab.
2.  **Readwise API Token**:
    *   Go to [https://readwise.io/access_token](https://readwise.io/access_token) to obtain your Readwise API Token.
    *   Paste this token into the `TOKEN` variable in the first code cell of the notebook.
3.  **Anthropic API Key**:
    *   Obtain an Anthropic API Key.
    *   **Recommended**: Store your API key securely in Google Colab Secrets. Click the 🔑 icon in the left sidebar, add a new secret, and name it `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
    *   Alternatively, the notebook will prompt you to paste it if not found in secrets.

## Usage

1.  **Update API Keys**: Ensure your Readwise and Anthropic API keys are set up as described in the "Setup" section.
2.  **Run All Cells**: Execute all code cells in the notebook sequentially. Colab provides a "Run all" option in the Runtime menu.
3.  **Review Output**:
    *   The notebook will display a preview of your Readwise data and the generated weekly digest.
    *   Files will be automatically saved to your Colab environment and can be downloaded.

## Output Files

Upon successful execution, the following files will be generated in your Colab environment:

*   `readwise_last_7_days_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`: A CSV file containing all fetched documents and highlights.
*   `readwise_last_7_days_YYYY-MM-DD.md`: A Markdown table version of the raw data.
*   `Weekly_Digest_YYYY-MM-DD.md`: Your personalized weekly research digest generated by Claude.

## Customization

*   **`days_back`**: In the first code cell, you can modify the `days_back` variable to fetch data for a different period (e.g., `days_back = 14` for the last two weeks).
*   **Claude Model**: In the cell generating the digest, you can adjust the `model` parameter for the Anthropic client if you wish to experiment with different Claude models (e.g., `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for faster, cheaper responses, or `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` for maximum quality).
