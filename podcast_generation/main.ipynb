    ("Dave", "For sure. I mean, the guy basically wrote the playbook on calm, calculated leadership. So, how about we start with lesson number one: Patience and Timing."),

    ("Dave", "That’s classic Sonny! He reacts emotionally, but the Don—he knows better. He understands that real power comes from waiting for the right moment. No rush, no impulsive decisions. That’s where the long game comes in, and it’s something leaders can really learn from."),
    ("Sarah", "Exactly. It’s all about patience. Don Corleone’s approach teaches us that, in business or in life, acting too quickly often leads to missed opportunities. Keeping your cool can make all the difference."),
    ("Dave", "Oh yeah, that’s a powerful one. It’s a reminder that anyone can rise to the top if they stay patient and observant. Impulsive reactions? Those are for the weak. Great leaders—like the Don—know when to act and when to wait."),
